# CS 240B Advanced Databases

**Time**: 4pm-5:50pm &nbsp; **Location**: Boelter 5280 &nbsp; **Instructor**: [Remy Wang](https://remy.wang)

This is a graduate-level research-oriented course offered in Fall 2025.
The course aims to introduce foundational knowledge and discuss recent advances
 in Databases.
We will focus on the algorithmic aspect of data processing this quarter.

The lectures will be based on [notes](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~paris/lecture-notes/)
 from a similar course at Universiy of Wisconsin
 (thanks to [Paris Koutris](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~paris/) who gave us the permission to use his notes).

## Prerequisites

The students are expected to be familiar with the inner workings of relational
 databases, including the relational algebra, SQL, and join algorithms.

## Grading

50% of the grade is based on homework assignments (every two weeks),
 involving writing both proofs and programs.
The other 50% of the grade is based on a final project/report.
