* Write a program that uses an ILP solver to find the generalized hypertree width of the hypergraphs in the [hyperbench CQ dataset](http://hyperbench.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/hypergraph/2222).

* Write a program that uses a LP sovler to find the fractional hypertree width of the hypergraphs in the dataset.

Run your implementation on as many inputs as possible from the CQ dataset (some will time out).
